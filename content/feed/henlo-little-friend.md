body_eng: The relief efforts were hindered by the composition of the mud, which
  made it nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck. By the time
  relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the
  victims with serious injuries were dead. The relief workers were horrified by
  the landscape of fallen trees, disfigured human bodies, and piles of debris
  from entire houses. This was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the
  20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the
  fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500. The event was a
  foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by the populace's unawareness of the
  volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned
  authorities and media outlets about the danger over the weeks and days leading
  up to the eruption. Hazard maps for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly
  distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were
  made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in
  their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had
  ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the
  sounds of the eruption until it was too late.

Los esfuerzos de rescate fueron obstaculizados por el lodo, que hacía casi imposible el moverse sin quedar atrapado. Para el momento en el que los rescatistas alcanzaron Armero, doce horas después de la erupción, muchas de las víctimas con heridas graves ya habían muerto. Alrededor del mundo se publicaron tomas de vídeo y fotografías de Omayra Sánchez, una adolescente víctima de la tragedia, que estuvo atrapada durante tres días hasta que finalmente falleció. Otras fotografías del impacto del desastre llamaron la atención de la opinión pública e iniciaron una controversia sobre el grado de responsabilidad del gobierno colombiano en la catástrofe.
